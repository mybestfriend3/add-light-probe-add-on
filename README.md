# add-light-probe-add-on
Blender 2.8 add-on to add a light probe aligned with selected vertices<BR>
Intall the zip as usual<BR>
Select one object or more in 3Dview (eventually in edit mode), type  F3 and search for "aligned"<BR>
Choose the type(s) of probe(s) to be added (eventually just a bounding box)<BR>
Choose a number of samples of rotation around different axis (if needed) and beware brut force is used (avoid too many samples)<BR>
Select "mimic drivers" if the probe parameters are to be copied from probes named "AlignedCubeMapBase" and "AlignedIrrVolBase"<BR>
Press OK et voila
