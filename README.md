# add-light-probe-add-on
Blender add-on to add a light probe aligned with selected vertices<BR>
Intall the zip as usual
Select one object or more in 3dview (eventually in edit mode), type  F3 and search for "aligned"
Choose the type(s) of probe(s) to be added (eventually just a bounding box)
Choose samples of rotation along differents axis (if needed) and beware brut force is used (avoid too many samples)
Select "mimic drivers" if the probe parameters are to be copied from probes named "AlignedCubeMapBase" and "AlignedIrrVolBas"
Press OK et voila
